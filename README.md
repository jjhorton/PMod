# PMod boards
A selection of Random PMod Boards to be used with FPGA's that use the Digilent PMod standard connection

# Board Status
The boards in the table are being checked using github actions ![Kibot](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot) for the KiCAD files and also building the example code for each one online. The fabrication files produced using Gitfub actions also includes a PDF of the schematic and GERBER files for getting PCB's built using ![JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com).
